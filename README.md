# FF-14 Mount Collection Organizer


## Description

The project is to create a Front-End React website that manipulates data fetched from a public API.

The API used in this project is available at: "https://ffxivcollect.com/" and the end result is a website that allows users to organize their FF14 mounts.


## Technologies 

Utilized CSS, ReactJS, React-Bootstrap


## Challenges

Some of the technical challenges I faced during the project were:

- meeting some of the stretch goals:
    - making use of some of the React hooks such as: useContext() and useReducer()
    - making use of the Local Storage
    - using Axios
- styling the wesbite using a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap


## Future Implementations

- meeting the stretch goals
- adding more components to the website 
- making use of the Bootstrap more


## Installation

- Fork or clone the repo into a repository


## Routes

- Some of the available routes when starting up the React application:
    - Home: "/"
    - Mount List: "/mountlist"
    - My Collection: "/mycollection"
    - My Collection(index): "/mycollection/:index"
    - Wishlist: "/wishlist"
    - Wishlist(index): "/wishlist/:index"
    - About: "/about"
